<h1>Welcome to the personal television archive website of vnesech2!</h1>
In this website, there's no exception for who can contribute to this project, if they agree to share some of their files to this archive storage and want to store it in the permanent cloud.<br>
The contributions and recordings of myself will be presented on this website, however because of some hosting problems, all of them will be stored only in the cloud and won't be seen here.<br>
If you want to have some of them, or want to contribute something to this project, please contact me using: <a href="https://fb.com/element1242">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/@tpvtelevision.01">YouTube</a> or via email: cbds170109@gmail.com
